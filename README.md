# jupyter

Repo for practicing all thing Jupyter Notebook

To install all the packages required to run this, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Preferably use a virtual environment to keep the dependency conflicts at bay.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. `cd` into the directory where the jupyter notebooks are present.
2. Start the server using:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will automatically open the default browser with jupyter notebook open inside of it.
